Indoor Positioning files for Anne, Marvin and Cilly needed to be rerecorded based on the video of the recording from before.
Indoor Positioning files for Antonia, Jonas, Ana, Julius-2, Fabi and Julius were recorded with misplaced beacons for Major=1 and Minor=[2, 10]

Beacon configuration:
	- Interval:
		- Blue-Up : 200
		- Estimote : 201
